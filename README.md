# DBS-Simulation-Rubin-Terman
This is work done by a former masters student to replicate a simulation of deep brain stimulation as published by rubin & terman (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15114047).

After replicating the work, the student attempted to modify the model by replacing hodgkin-huxley style neurons with izikevich neurons.

This code should work but it needs to be 'curated' - organized, proof-read, add readmes and sample runs, etc.
